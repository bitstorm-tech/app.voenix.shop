- See the mug variants controller to see how the work in the backend @backend/src/main/kotlin/com/jotoai/voenix/shop/mugs/controller/MugVariantController.kt
- Added variants shall be displayed in a list with cards
- It shall be possible to add or remove variants and persist these changes in the backend
